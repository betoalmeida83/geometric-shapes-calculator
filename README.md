# Geometric Shapes Calculator in Java

This is a Java project that implements area and perimeter calculations for various geometric shapes using **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **enums**, and **interfaces**.  
It is designed for **educational purposes**, **object-oriented programming (OOP) practice**, and for understanding the difference between **inheritance** and **contract implementation** through interfaces.


# Features

- Area and perimeter calculations for:
  - Circle
  - Square
  - Rectangle
  - Triangle types:
    - Equilateral
    - Isosceles
    - Scalene
  - Rhombus
  - Parallelogram
  - Trapezoid
- Uses `enum` for color representation
- Command-line interface
- Built in pure Java (no frameworks or GUI)
